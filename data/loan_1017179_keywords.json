    "Description": "Alice is 53 years old and has six children. She is a group leader and is representing her group formed by ten farmers in Webuye District, Kenya. <br /><br />Alice has been farming with One Acre Fund for years now, having joined the program for the first time in 2009. This decision was largely as a result of her desire to have access to quality training and acquire new farming methods. Although she described her last harvest as good, she believes she could have a better one this year by continuing to work alongside One Acre Fund. <br /><br />Alice also decided to purchase a solar light as well as a sheep as part of her loan, which she is very excited about, as the solar light will allow her to have light during dark hours for her children to be able to study.<br /><br />Obtaining this loan means that Alice's Group will be able to receive a total of seven solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 4.5 acres.",
    "Use": "to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost-efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.",
