    "Description": "A local resident living in a rural area of Kampong Cham province, Chhunla is a 27-year-old mother of one child. To make a living, she has been growing rice for 9 years. She can earn more income via selling mushrooms. For a few years, her business did not grow well as the drought affected her crop. Chhunla and her group members are seeking a first loan with VisionFund. As the leader of the group, she will manage her loan portion to buy rice seed, organic pesticide and fertilizer to support her rice farm in order to produce a good yield. She hopes this year her rice can produce a higher yield so that she can sell it at a higher price, which will enable her to save sufficient capital to support her business next year.",
