Hasmik is a housewife and also a good farmer. <br /><br />On her farm she takes care of 3 cows, 4 calves, 2 heifers, a bull, 9 sheep and a horse. She also perfectly cares for her land and on it she cultivates potato, greens and cucumbers. She sells her farm products locally, since she is alone in all these activities. Her husband works in construction; he works without holidays and until late at night. Sometimes only Hasmik\u2019s daughter helps her, especially when at harvest time. <br /><br />Hasmik is very worried since it is the start of the peak of spring sowing activities, but she has a lack of money to get prepared. With this loan amount she hopes she will buy a great quantity of potato seedlings and also some animal fodder for her farm cattle.",
