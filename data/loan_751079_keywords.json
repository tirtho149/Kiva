    "Description": "Samaila is a maize farmer and member of Babban Gona. Samaila joined Babban Gona primarily to create a better future for his  children: Asiya, Safarau, and  Safara. Samaila is excited that Babban Gona offers a lasting solution to ending the cycle of poverty. For the first time, Samaila will have access to quality inputs such as fertilizer and seed. Without this loan, he would be subjected to buying these products in the open market where the products are not only very expensive but are often diluted with external products such as sand. With access to high quality inputs, Samaila can reap up to 30 bags/hectare, double the national average of 14 and  earn up to $2000/ha: more than three times the average Nigerian farmer\u2019s annual income.  When asked how he plans to spend the income he will make this year  as a Babban Gona member, he said, \u201cI plan to use the money  to provide more food and clothing for my family.\u201d Samaila is not thinking about this year alone; he expressed that his longterm goal is to \u201cmake more money for myself and my family\u201d. With this loan, he is well on his way to achieving this goal. \n",
