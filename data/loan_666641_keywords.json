    "Description": "Savorn, 38, is a mother with three children. Currently, she needs to support only one child who is in school. The main sources of her family\u2019s income are rice farming (on 1.5 hectares of land) and fishing selling. These businesses generate about 19,400 KHR per day for her. Including this loan, Savorn and her co-borrower are third-time borrowers with VisionFund (Kiva's partner). This group of two is requesting a new loan of 1,000,000 KHR each. As the leader, Savorn will spend her entire loan portion to buy rice seed, fertilizer, gasoline for irrigation, and insecticide for her crop. She hopes that she can triple the yield of her crop so that she can keep her child in school until tertiary level.",
