    "Description": "Everlyne is 56 years old and is often described as a very trustworthy person. She has three children and is married. As the group leader, Everlyne is representing her group of 11 farmers in Teso District in Kenya, and is very excited to be working with One Acre Fund for the first time this year.<br /><br />The decision to join One Acre Fund was largely as a result of Everlyne's desire to have access to quality training and acquire new farming methods. In addition to receiving farming inputs, she is also purchasing a solar light as part of her loan, which is very exciting to her as she will now be able to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money. With the profits that she gains from this year\u2019s harvest, she plans to send her children to school.<br /><br />Everlyne and her group will receive a total of nine solar lights as well as input loans of maize and fertilizer to plant a total of 3.75 acres.",
