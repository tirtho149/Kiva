    "Description": "Margarit lives with her parents-in-law, her husband and their 3-year-old child (in the photo) in Spandaryan village. <br /><br />Margarit and her family are involved in a farming business. The family keeps a big stock of cows, calves, oxen, pigs, sheep, lambs and hens. They also cultivate barley, wheat and potatoes. <br /><br />The main difficulty Margarit and her family face with the farming business is that they are hardly able to sell the farming produce in the nearby market because customers want to purchase products non cash, by credit. Margarit and her family usually change the farming produce for other necessary products needed for their everyday living. <br /><br />The requested loan will greatly help Margarit and her family to purchase a horse, four cows and forage for feeding the livestock. This will be a helping hand for this hardworking family and they hope for lenders' support.",
