    "Description": "Ana is 38 years old, married and is both a housewife and farmer. She has worked in agriculture ever since she was a young girl when her parents taught her about the land where she now grows coffee, corn, and beans. Ana has four children. The eldest attended school for nine years, the second completed primary school, and the last two are in different grades in primary school. A grandson also lives with her.\r\n\r\nThe land she and her husband work is their own thanks to a purchase from one of their customers some time ago. It is located 15 minutes away by road; sometimes she goes there by horse or donkey.\r\n\r\nAna is seeking a loan from the Comixmul Cooperative so she can pay for technical assistance with her crops. She would like to know more about weeding, fertilization, manure etc. in order to get better harvests.\r\n\r\nHer future plan is to be able to grow a better variety of coffee like Bourbon, Caturra, and Lempira so that the beans she grows will be competitive and attractive to local and national markets.\r\n\r\nAna's dream is to see her children attend university and get good jobs.\r\n",
    "Use": "Buy agricultural supplies and pay for technical assistance.",

    "Keywords": "The keywords related to loan's purpose would be agricultural supplies and technical assistance.\n\nThe  target audience for this loan is likely small-scale farmers, particularly women in rural areas who require financial support to improve their agricultural practices and increase their yields.\n\nImportant themes in the description and image include sustainable agriculture and coffee production. The image of Ana in her coffee plants and looking for advice on technical tools also suggests that the use of loan is related to agriculture practices, thus keywords 'weeding, fertilization, and manure' are also appropriate.  \n\nSome more possessions and character sounding keywords are \"coffee production, agricultural practices, economic bolster, primary education and higher education\".  The shipping/purchasing related words could be \" infrastructures, technologies \", the social function words are \" marriage, families \", \"gender - equality \".
