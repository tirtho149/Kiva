    "Description": "Nahashon is a member of this group in Lugari District. He is pictured here in a group of five One Acre Fund group leader farmers. The group leaders represent a total of 58 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. Nahashon has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 KES for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nNahashon is married and has four children. He is 52 years old and is known as a friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy, and experienced farmer.  He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group. Nahashon has been a farmer for 22 years. Nahashon did not work with One Acre Fund last year, but believes he can have an even better harvest this year by working with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nNahashon first enrolled with One Acre Fund this year and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Nahashon joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, learn new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed his family, and send his children to school. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member. He wants to help more farmers and wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Nahashon plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school, to repair his home, to save for the future, and to buy a cow. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  \t\t\t\r\n\r\nNahashon and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\r\n",
