Even though Violet is the only one featured in the above picture, she is actually representing her group formed by 12 farmers in Webuye District, Kenya.<br /><br />Violet started working alongside One Acre Fund a few years ago, in 2010, and decided to do so because she wanted to have access to quality training and acquire new farming methods. Since then, she has seen her life improve, especially in the sense that she has been able to consistently feed her family. This year, she decided to represent her group because she wanted to help more farmers.<br /><br />Violet\u2019s Group will receive enough farming supplies to plant a total of 6.5 acres of land.
