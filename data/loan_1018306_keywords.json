    "Description": "Ezron is 45 years old and has 6 children. He is a group leader and is representing his group formed by 14 farmers in Webuye District, Kenya. \r\n\r\nEzron has been farming with One Acre Fund for years now, having joined the program for the first time in 2012. This decision was largely as a result of his desire to have access to quality training and to acquire new farming methods and, although he described his last harvest as good, he believes he could have a better one this year by continuing to work alongside One Acre Fund. Ezron also decided to purchase a solar light as part of his loan, which he is very excited about, as it will allow him to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money.\r\n\r\nObtaining this loan means that Ezron's Group will be able to receive a total of 10 solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 7 acres.\t\t\t\t\r\n",
    "Use": "to purchase a solar light and to gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.",
